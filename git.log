    Version 3.3.07

    Version 3.3.06
    An external $config_file is now simply a php file (was an ini).
      So, now uses include($config_file) instead of parse_ini_file($config_file).
    Added some comments for $config_file
    Increased hash iterations from 1000 to 10000.
      (I've read that lots of iterations help slow down brute force p/w recovery)
    Updated hash for default "password".
    Created Page_Header() & moved <div class=header> code to it.
    show_favicon(): now returns string instead of echo'ing it.
    Upload_response(): changed $_['bytes_01'] (it wasn't defined) to $_['meta_txt_02'].
    Created Set_Input_width() for use in Copy_Ren_Move_Page().
    style_sheet(): Set width of input type="text" to 99.5%
    Adjusted css for label
    A couple of minor text spacing improvements.
